# Youtube-DL GUI
This is a GUI, written using the customtkinter and tkinter libraries, that will download youtube videos in the highest possible quality. To get started, clone this github repo and run the command ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

The GUI looks like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120294776/208224719-290ef42a-b20d-405a-8cb6-5a7cd287f963.png)

You can create a custom directory in the ``config.py`` file, specify one in the app, or leave the box blank and use the automatically created directory. 
The program uses the module ``PyTube`` to download videos in mp4 format.
